## Introduction
The incidence of musculoskeletal disorders, especially those involving the knee, including osteoarthritis (OA), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, and meniscal injuries, is a major global healthcare concern that has a profound effect on the mobility and quality of life of affected patients. Conventional diagnostic tools, especially X-ray radiography, have several limitations, including the inability to image soft tissues, often resulting in the missed diagnosis of early degenerative changes until late-stage damage has been incurred [@panwar2025early]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has recently become the standard diagnostic tool for musculoskeletal imaging because of its high contrast resolution and multi-planar imaging capabilities, which enable the detailed evaluation of ligaments, cartilage, and bone marrow [@qiu2021fusion]. However, the current manual analysis of knee MRI scans is a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially with regard to inter-observer variability and the high cognitive load of radiologists, which can result in delays in diagnosis and treatment [@bien2018deep].

The synergy of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), provides a revolutionary approach to overcome these diagnostic hurdles by enabling an automated, objective, and scalable analysis of complex medical images [@oettl2025beyond]. CNNs are especially suited for medical imaging applications because they have the capability to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations directly from raw pixel data, including subtle pathological patterns that may not be visible to the human eye [@yeoh2021emergence]. Recent breakthroughs have shown the effectiveness of both 2D and 3D CNN models for segmenting musculoskeletal tissues and grading the severity of structural damage [@liu2018deep; @guida2021knee]. However, there are still major challenges to overcome in the current state of research, such as the requirement for large and high-quality annotated datasets and the lack of generalizability of models across different MRI protocols and hardware configurations [@goel2025federated].

To overcome these challenges, there is an urgent need for the development of efficient automated systems that are capable of multi-pathology detection and grading to help doctors in high-throughput settings [@astuto2021automatic]. Although specialized models have proved to be successful in specific tasks like the detection of ACL tears using self-supervised learning techniques [@aidarkhan2025self] or staging meniscus degeneration [@pedoia20193d], the development of a comprehensive framework that can distinguish between different simultaneous knee injuries is still an intricate challenge. This research work is driven by the need to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis in orthopedic radiology. Using the latest advancements in CNN models, this research aims to develop an automated system for the detection and grading of knee pathologies from MRI images, which can eventually help in providing better patient care strategies for early intervention [@awan2021improved].

## 1 Introduction

The incidence of musculoskeletal disorders, especially those involving the knee, including osteoarthritis (OA), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, and meniscal injuries, is a major global healthcare concern that has a profound effect on the mobility and quality of life of affected patients. Conventional diagnostic tools, especially X-ray radiography, have several limitations, including the inability to image soft tissues, often resulting in the missed diagnosis of early degenerative changes until late-stage damage has been incurred [@panwar2025early]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has recently become the standard diagnostic tool for musculoskeletal imaging because of its high contrast resolution and multi-planar imaging capabilities, which enable the detailed evaluation of ligaments, cartilage, and bone marrow [@qiu2021fusion]. However, the current manual analysis of knee MRI scans is a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially with regard to inter-observer variability and the high cognitive load of radiologists, which can result in delays in diagnosis and treatment [@bien2018deep].

Conventional MRI assessment of the knee relies on manual segmentation of anatomical structures, which is time-consuming and prone to variability. Zhou et al. (2018) demonstrated that a deep convolutional neural network can automatically segment knee joint tissues, including cartilage and meniscus, providing accurate and consistent delineation to support more efficient analysis of knee anatomy and pathology [@zhou2018deep]

The synergy of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), provides a revolutionary approach to overcome these diagnostic hurdles by enabling an automated, objective, and scalable analysis of complex medical images [@oettl2025beyond]. CNNs are especially suited for medical imaging applications because they have the capability to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations directly from raw pixel data, including subtle pathological patterns that may not be visible to the human eye [@yeoh2021emergence]. Recent breakthroughs have shown the effectiveness of both 2D and 3D CNN models for segmenting musculoskeletal tissues and grading the severity of structural damage [@liu2018deep; @guida2021knee]. However, there are still major challenges to overcome in the current state of research, such as the requirement for large and high-quality annotated datasets and the lack of generalizability of models across different MRI protocols and hardware configurations [@goel2025federated].

To overcome these challenges, there is an urgent need for the development of efficient automated systems that are capable of multi-pathology detection and grading to help doctors in high-throughput settings [@astuto2021automatic]. Although specialized models have proved to be successful in specific tasks like the detection of ACL tears using self-supervised learning techniques [@aidarkhan2025self] or staging meniscus degeneration [@pedoia20193d], the development of a comprehensive framework that can distinguish between different simultaneous knee injuries is still an intricate challenge. Using the latest advancements in CNN models, this research aims to develop an automated system for the detection and grading of knee pathologies from MRI images, which can eventually help in providing better patient care strategies for early intervention [@awan2021improved].

This research work is driven by the need to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis in orthopedic radiology.


## 2 Methods

## 3 Analysis & Results:

### 3.1 Dataset Description:
The MRNet dataset, a publicly available set of knee MRI scans gathered by the School of Medicine at Stanford University, is used in this research. The dataset contains images gathered from clinical studies performed at the Stanford University Medical Center over an eleven-year period from 2001 to 2012.
The structure of the dataset is divided into a training and validation set, with each MRI study labeled for three different diagnoses: 

- The presence of any abnormality, 
- Tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL),
- Meniscal injuries.

#### 3.1.2 Data Organization
The dataset has a standardized partition structure, with a train/ directory for model development and a valid/ directory for model evaluation. The diagnostic ground truth is provided in the form of two CSV files, namely train-acl.csv and valid-acl.csv, each containing the examination identifier and a binary diagnostic label, where 0 represents the absence of an ACL tear and 1 represents a confirmed ACL tear.

#### 3.1.3 Problem Formulation
The task of clinical diagnosis is posed as a binary classification problem, where the goal of the model is to distinguish between ACL-intact and ACL-compromised knee examinations. Mathematically, the binary classification problem can be stated as:

$$
y=\begin{cases}
0 & \text{No ACL tear present} \\ 
1 & \text{ACL tear present} 
\end{cases}
$$
This problem statement allows the construction of a supervised learning model that can be used to automatically identify ACL tears from multi-planar MRI images.

### 3.2 Dataset Visualization & Exploratory Analysis:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental component of any machine learning model's pipeline. It is critical to understand the structure and composition of the data before moving forward to train any model. This section of the report outlines a detailed exploratory data analysis of the MRNet dataset, proposed by [@bien2018deep]. in 2018, which consists of knee MRI images from three different imaging planes, i.e., sagittal, coronal, and axial. Each of these imaging sessions is associated with a binary variable representing the ACL tear condition of the knee. The class balance, volumetric structure, imaging characteristics, and cross-plane imaging of the MRNet dataset have all been addressed in the following visualizations, which were critical to the decisions made in the subsequent sections of this report.

#### 3.2.1 Class Distribution

The bar chart describes the class distribution of the ACL tear labels in the data set. The horizontal axis indicates the two classes in the diagnostic results, namely "No ACL Tear" and "ACL Tear," while the vertical axis indicates the number of examinations in the data set. The data set contains a total of 1,130 examinations, with 922 (81.6%) labeled as "No ACL Tear" and 208 (18.4%) labeled as "ACL Tear." This is a significant imbalance between the two classes, with an approximate ratio of 4.4:1 in favor of the negative class. This imbalance is clinically realistic, since ACL tears are not as common in the general population as the converse; nonetheless, it is a significant methodological limitation in the application of supervised machine learning, since a model trained on such an unbalanced data set will likely develop a bias toward the majority class, thereby achieving high accuracy but at the expense of poor sensitivity for the clinically important minority class. This figure is important because it establishes the underlying data set characteristics that directly influence the model design, loss function, and evaluation metric used in the study.

#### 3.2.2 Sample Middle Slices from the Sagittal Plane

The following figure depicts four sample middle sagittal plane MRI slice images from the dataset, showing instances of both positive and negative ACL tear classes. As shown, each image has been labeled with the patient ID and the associated label, with "ACL Tear" instances depicted in red and "No ACL Tear" instances depicted in blue, based on their associated IDs 1 and 18, and 0 and 2, respectively. As depicted, the images have been shown in grayscale, consistent with standard MRI acquisition procedures. As shown, there are discernible structural differences in the ACL-tear and no ACL-tear classes, with the ACL-tear classes showing a lack of the characteristic linear hypointense feature representing the ligament, while the no ACL-tear classes show a well-defined ligamentous feature. However, discernible variability in knee orientation, contrast, and soft tissue intensity may be observed among the four sample images, showing the inherent variability in clinical data. As shown, the variability among the samples demonstrates the complexity of the classification task, warranting the use of deep learning architectures that are capable of learning complex hierarchical representations without relying on feature engineering.

#### 3.2.3 Distribution of Slice Counts per Examination (Sagittal Plane)

The above histogram shows the distribution of the number of slices in the sagittal plane for each MRI exam. The horizontal axis shows the number of slices in each exam. This varies from around 15 slices to around 50 slices. The vertical axis shows the number of exams. The distribution of slices in the sagittal plane appears to be approximately unimodal. The main peak occurs at around 25 slices per exam, with approximately 150 exams. There is a smaller peak around 30-35 slices per exam, with around 100-110 exams. The distribution of slices in the sagittal plane appears skewed to the right. This means that a long tail of the distribution goes towards a maximum of 50 slices per exam. Here, the number of exams is less than 5. This variation in the number of slices in the sagittal plane arises due to the inherent variation in clinical images. This variation arises because different imaging protocols are followed in different hospitals and institutions. This figure is of great importance as it guides the way in which the volumetric inputs are standardized during the preprocessing stage.

#### 3.2.4 Pixel Intensity

The histogram in the above image demonstrates the pixel intensity values for a random selection of ten images. The horizontal axis of the histogram ranges from values lower than 0 up to 255. The vertical axis of the histogram corresponds to the values’ frequencies. The values are highly skewed towards the right. The highest frequency values are concentrated in the lower intensity values and reach a peak of around 20-25. The frequency value in this region approaches 2000. After this peak, the values decrease gradually as the intensity increases. This demonstrates that the pixels in an MRI image are not uniformly distributed. The presence of a secondary peak of around 300 occurs when the intensity reaches its maximum value of 255. This could be due to the presence of pixels in images of joint effusion. This figure is useful as it justifies the normalization of all the images before they are fed into the model for training.

## 1 Introduction

The incidence of musculoskeletal disorders, especially those involving the knee, including osteoarthritis (OA), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, and meniscal injuries, is a major global healthcare concern that has a profound effect on the mobility and quality of life of affected patients. Conventional diagnostic tools, especially X-ray radiography, have several limitations, including the inability to image soft tissues, often resulting in the missed diagnosis of early degenerative changes until late-stage damage has been incurred [@panwar2025early]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has recently become the standard diagnostic tool for musculoskeletal imaging because of its high contrast resolution and multi-planar imaging capabilities, which enable the detailed evaluation of ligaments, cartilage, and bone marrow [@qiu2021fusion]. However, the current manual analysis of knee MRI scans is a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially with regard to inter-observer variability and the high cognitive load of radiologists, which can result in delays in diagnosis and treatment [@bien2018deep].

Conventional MRI assessment of the knee relies on manual segmentation of anatomical structures, which is time-consuming and prone to variability. Zhou et al. (2018) demonstrated that a deep convolutional neural network can automatically segment knee joint tissues, including cartilage and meniscus, providing accurate and consistent delineation to support more efficient analysis of knee anatomy and pathology [@zhou2018deep]

The synergy of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), provides a revolutionary approach to overcome these diagnostic hurdles by enabling an automated, objective, and scalable analysis of complex medical images [@oettl2025beyond]. CNNs are especially suited for medical imaging applications because they have the capability to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations directly from raw pixel data, including subtle pathological patterns that may not be visible to the human eye [@yeoh2021emergence]. Recent breakthroughs have shown the effectiveness of both 2D and 3D CNN models for segmenting musculoskeletal tissues and grading the severity of structural damage [@liu2018deep; @guida2021knee]. However, there are still major challenges to overcome in the current state of research, such as the requirement for large and high-quality annotated datasets and the lack of generalizability of models across different MRI protocols and hardware configurations [@goel2025federated].

To overcome these challenges, there is an urgent need for the development of efficient automated systems that are capable of multi-pathology detection and grading to help doctors in high-throughput settings [@astuto2021automatic]. Although specialized models have proved to be successful in specific tasks like the detection of ACL tears using self-supervised learning techniques [@aidarkhan2025self] or staging meniscus degeneration [@pedoia20193d], the development of a comprehensive framework that can distinguish between different simultaneous knee injuries is still an intricate challenge. Using the latest advancements in CNN models, this research aims to develop an automated system for the detection and grading of knee pathologies from MRI images, which can eventually help in providing better patient care strategies for early intervention [@awan2021improved].

This research work is driven by the need to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis in orthopedic radiology.


## 2 Methods

## 3 Analysis & Results:

### 3.1 Dataset Description:
The MRNet dataset, a publicly available set of knee MRI scans gathered by the School of Medicine at Stanford University, is used in this research. The dataset contains images gathered from clinical studies performed at the Stanford University Medical Center over an eleven-year period from 2001 to 2012.
The structure of the dataset is divided into a training and validation set, with each MRI study labeled for three different diagnoses: 

The presence of any abnormality, 
Tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL),
Meniscal injuries.

#### Data Organization
The dataset has a standardized partition structure, with a train/ directory for model development and a valid/ directory for model evaluation. The diagnostic ground truth is provided in the form of two CSV files, namely train-acl.csv and valid-acl.csv, each containing the examination identifier and a binary diagnostic label, where 0 represents the absence of an ACL tear and 1 represents a confirmed ACL tear.

#### Problem Formulation
The task of clinical diagnosis is posed as a binary classification problem, where the goal of the model is to distinguish between ACL-intact and ACL-compromised knee examinations. Mathematically, the binary classification problem can be stated as:
y={0No ACL tear present1ACL tear presenty = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{No ACL tear present} \\ 1 & \text{ACL tear present} \end{cases}y={01​No ACL tear presentACL tear present​
This problem statement allows the construction of a supervised learning model that can be used to automatically identify ACL tears from multi-planar MRI images[@yeoh2021emergence].

#### Visualization:

Manual assessment of knee osteoarthritis severity is often time-consuming and subjective. A recent study demonstrated that a CNN-based deep learning model can automatically detect and grade knee osteoarthritis from imaging data, providing accurate and consistent classification that can support faster and more reliable diagnosis.[@rani2024deep]

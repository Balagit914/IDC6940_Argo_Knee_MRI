## Introduction
The aim of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of the performance of DL techniques, like Res-Net and Dense Net. As a result of exploring the capabilities of these two neural networks, we are aiming to determine their effectiveness and suitability for classifying the knee pathologies. Deep Learning (DL) architectures, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are a flexible class of computational models that combine the strengths of hierarchical feature extraction and automated pattern recognition (LeCun et al. 2015). Like traditional image processing, CNNs can model complex visual data, such as medical radiographs and scans. However, modern architectures like DenseNet (Densely Connected Networks) and ResNet (Residual Networks) extend standard CNNs by incorporating advanced connectivity patterns such as skip connections and feature concatenation which account for the vanishing gradient problem and the need for efficient feature reuse. Wang et al. (2024) noted that manual diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears often struggles with inter-observer variability and the high cognitive load placed on radiologists. This made it difficult to provide consistent, rapid outcomes for patients. But the specialized layers in ResNet and DenseNet help model the complex relationships within image patches and allow for the detection of patterns that are not captured by traditional linear measurements.

Similarly, Awan et al. (2021) utilize a deep learning approach to investigate the efficient detection of knee ACL injuries from MRI data. In their analysis, they demonstrate how optimized CNN architectures account for variation in regional joint data, proving that deep learning provides both the flexibility and tractability required for reliable medical classification.

This study investigates the potential for diagnosis of knee pathologies particularly focusing on the accurate classification of ACL injuries. To analyze these risks, we will apply  different cnn models which can be used for complex data.
